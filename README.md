# JS-Logical_Operator
Logical operators in JavaScript make conditional statements much more powerful and flexible! Here’s a quick rundown:
AND (&&): Ensures all conditions are met. Great for specific cases where every criterion is essential!
Example: “Are they 18+ and have an ID?”

OR (||): Allows flexibility—only one condition needs to be true. Perfect for options like weekends or holidays!
Example: “Is it weekend OR a holiday?”

NOT (!): Inverts conditions, often simplifying logic.
Example: “Is it NOT raining?”
